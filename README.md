# Catvice client side

Catvice is a client-side iOS app that shows you random cat images and quotes, you can choose to see more with a button at the bottom of the view.
I'm fetching data from APIs within my Swift server-side app. 

## Frameworks

I used **SwiftUI** for the User Interface and **Vapor** as Web framework to build the server side.
